The following tutorial is a quickstart guide for operating a clockdrive system for celestial tracking.

You'll need the following:

. CG-4 German equatorial mount
. Nema17 stepper motor
. Raspberry Pi 3B+
. DRV8824 stepper motor driver

== Setup/Installation

Coming soon...

== Run clockdrive

Once the StellarDynamics package is loaded, evaluate the following to compute the step duration needed operate the clockdrive system:

```
clockdrive := SDClockDrive new stepsPerRev: 200 microstepRes: 1/32 wormGearRatio: 130.
clockdrive stepDuration.
```
